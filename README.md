## World Total Fertility Rates Sex Ratio at Birth and Gross Reproduction Rate Per Country From 2020 to 2021

Fertility factors are determinants of the number of children that an individual is likely to have. Fertility factors are mostly positive or negative correlations without certain causations.
The world total fertility rate (TFR) is an estimate of the average number of children a woman would give birth to during her lifetime, based on prevailing fertility patterns in a given year.

Factors generally associated with increased fertility include the intention to have children, very high level of gender inequality, inter-generational transmission of values, marriage and cohabitation, maternal and social support, rural residence, pro family government programs, low IQ and increased food production.

I worked on the world total fertility rates, sex ratio at birth and gross reproduction rate per country from 2020 to 2021. The data was sourced out from BigQuery google cloud, using SQL commands. Analysis was carried out on both BigQuery and Spreadsheet and visualized using Tableau public.
